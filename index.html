  <h1>Cats and Dogs</h1>
  
  <h2>History of Cats and Dogs</h2>
  <p><ul>
  <li> Dogs originally evolved from gray wolves. Humans encountered gray wolves during their migrations and gradually domesticated 
  them into modern dogs by selectively breeding gentle individuals and using them to help humans.</li>
</ul>
 <ul>
 <li>Domestic cats are generally believed to have originated from the African wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica).
 Cats were domesticated later than dogs, beginning approximately 6,000 years ago in the agricultural society of ancient Egypt.
 With the development of agriculture, granaries attracted large numbers of rats, and wild cats followed. Humans discovered that 
cats were effective at catching rats, so they began to keep them in their homes to protect food.</li>

  and paying attention to regular health checks, deworming, and vaccinations. In addition, socialization training should be

   <li> About dog:It is necessary to pay attention to diet, living environment, health management and training. In the early stage of returning home,
    the puppy should be provided with a quiet and comfortable environment, and fed with small amounts of frequent meals. At the same time, 
    it should be kept warm and avoid frequent bathing. Ensuring that it is vaccinated on time and dewormed regularly is the key to its health. 
    Both indoor and outdoor environments should be managed safely.</li></ul>
